brief: `\n1. 注册分为多种方式\n- 使用用户名注册（username）\n- 使用邮箱注册（email）\n- 使用手机号注册（phone）\n- 社会化账号（微信、GitHub）注册(unionid)\n\n2. 部分请求参数说明\n    - userInfo\n        - 必填项\n            - \\`registerInClient\\`: 用户注册所在的用户池\n        - 可选项\n            - \\`registerMethod\\`:注册方式。开发者最好提供此字段，如未提供，Authing 将从其他是否提供 \\`unionid\\`，\\`email\\`, \\`phone\\`， \\`username\\` 四个字段推测注册方式（优先级递减，比如同时提供 \\`unionid\\` 和 \\`email\\`，会被视为 \\`unionid\\` 方式注册）。\n            - \\`unionid\\`\n            - \\`email\\`\n            - \\`phone\\`: 注：若管理员开启了注册白名单机制，此手机号需要在白名单之内。\n            - \\`password\\`: 加密过后的密码，加密方式见[Authing官方文档](https://docs.authing.cn/authing/v/master/sdk/open-graphql#zhu-yi-shi-xiang-2)。\n            - \\`forceLogin\\`: 默认为 false, 如果设置为 true, 用户不存在时会先自动创建。\n            - \\`photo\\`: 用户头像，如果域名不是 Authing 的 CDN，将会先被上传至 Authing CDN。\n            - \\`lastIP\\`: 用户注册时的 IP, 如果未提供，Authing 将会从请求中自动推断。\n    - invitationCode: 邀请码。可选。\n    - keepPassword: 是否直接将密码写入，内部不使用 Authing 的加密方式存储。\n\n3. 注册频率限制\n\n应用池管理员可以在后台开启频繁注册限制选项（**用户池** -> **基础配置**）。\n\n![](http://lcjim-img.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/2019-10-23-40FB8474-08F1-4586-83CB-CFC96B5A56A1.png)\n\n如上图中，**同一 IP** 在 300 秒内，只能发起 3 次注册请求。\n\n4. 注册白名单机制\n\n> 目前只支持手机号白名单，\n\n开发者可以配置白名单（**用户中心** -> **注册白名单**），只运行白名单内的手机号注册。\n\n5. 一键关闭注册选项\n\nAuthing 提供给开发者“一键关闭注册”选项，可在后台 **基础配置** 中设置。\n\n![](http://lcjim-img.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/2019-10-23-103351.png)\n\n`        ,\n            type: '用户鉴权'\n        },\n        login: {\n            name: '登录',\n            brief:

`\n此接口用来添加 Webhook。相关文档请查看 [Authing官方文档](https://learn.authing.cn/authing/advanced/use-webhook)\n1. Webhook 有什么用\n\nWebhooks 允许你对用户注册、登录等**事件**进行监听，从而对其做一些自定义处理。这能让 Authing 和你的业务更好地联动起来。\nAuthing 内置了丰富的事件，目前包含注册、登录、修改密码、修改用户信息、用户邮箱被验证五种。\n开发者可以在后台 **基础配置** -> **Webhook** 里面管理自己的 Webhook。\n\n![](http://lcjim-img.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/2019-10-24-102435.png)\n\n2. 支持事件列表\n\n> 支持的事件列表可以通过 “获取 Webhook 配置项” 接口获取。\n\n- register: 注册\n- change-user-info: 修改用户信息\n- login: 登录\n- change-password: 修改密码\n- email-verified: 用户邮箱被验证\n\n3. 有哪些应用场景？\n\n假设你的应用有 “用户验证邮箱可获积分” 这个业务需求，你可以添加一个监控 \\`email-verified\\` 事件的 Webhook, 每次有用户成功验证邮箱之后，\nAuthing 将会向你定义的 Webhook 地址发送携带该名用户ID的请求，然后你可以通过此用户的 ID 完成相关操作。\n\n4. Authing 的回调请求包含哪些数据？\n\n详情见“发送 Webhook 测试”部分的文档。\n\n5. 请求参数说明\n- 必填项\n    - client: 用户池 ID\n    - events: 监听的事件列表，具体的事件名称见上文。\n    - url: Webhook 回调地址\n    - contentType: 指定发起 Webhook 请求时 Request body 的数据格式，可选值有 \\`application/json\\` 和 \\`application/x-www-form-urlencoded\\`\n    - enable: 是否启用。\n- 可选参数\n    - secret: 请求秘钥。如果设置, Authing将会在向 Webhook 回调地址发起请求时，带上\\`X-Authing-Token\\` 的请求头。开发者可以对此秘钥进行验证，用来防止第三方的恶意请求。\n`,\n            tokenType: \"admin\"\n        },\n\n        getAllWebhooks: {\n            type: 'WebHook API',\n            name: \"获取用户池 WebHook 列表\",\n
